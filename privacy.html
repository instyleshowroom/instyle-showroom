                  referred to as the "Controller") and processes the personal data of users (hereinafter referred to as the

                <h4>A. What are Cookies?</h4>
                <p>The Site uses cookie technology. Cookies are small text files that are downloaded by the browser onto the
                  device used by the User (computer, tablet, smartphone) when they visit a website. Cookies are then
                  retransmitted to the original site during the browsing session or upon any subsequent visit by the User.
                </p>
      
                <p>There are several types of cookies. Some are strictly necessary for a website to function properly
                  (technical cookies), while others optimize its performance to provide a better user experience or allow you
                  to collect statistics on site usage ( analytical cookies) or to display personalized advertising (profiling
                  cookies).
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Our cookies are anonymous and cannot be linked to your personal data. First party cookies are associated
                  with the domain name of the page you are visiting and allow us to identify you by cross-referencing with
                  our database. Your identity is never directly included in the cookie and cannot be intercepted.
                </p>
      
      
                <p>Each time you access the Site, regardless of whether a cookie is present or not, we record your browser
                  type, operating system and host along with your source URL, as well as information about the page you
                  requested. This data may then be used in aggregate and anonymous form to perform statistical analysis of
                  website usage.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  B. Cookies Used on the Site
                </h4>
                <p>The list of technical, analytical and profiling cookies used on the Site is shown below:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>1. Technical cookies</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Technical cookies are necessary to allow safe and efficient exploration as well as proper functioning of
                  the Site and to improve the User experience. They also allow us to distinguish between the different Users
                  connected to the Site both for security reasons and in order to provide a service requested by the User. No
                  consent is required for these cookies. Technical cookies can be:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li style="list-style: disc inside;"><strong>“session” type,</strong> that ensure normal exploration and
                    use of the Site (e.g. for authentication to access secure areas). They are not used for further purposes
                    and are normally installed directly by the owner or operator of the website (so-called "proprietary
                    cookies").
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li><strong>“persistent” type</strong> that remain stored on the computer's hard drive until their typical
                    expiry or deletion by users/visitors. With the use of persistent cookies, visitors that access the Site
                    (or any other Users who use the same computer) are automatically recognised upon each visit. Persistent
                    cookies satisfy many features in the interest of surfers (e.g. language preferences). Visitors can set
                    the computer's browser so that it accepts/refuses all the cookies or display a warning each time a cookie
                    is offered in order to assess whether or not to accept it. The User is however entitled to modify the
                    default configuration and to disable cookies (i.e. to block them definitively) by setting the highest
                    level of protection.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>These type of cookies can also be:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><i>“first party””</i> when they are managed directly by the owner and/or operator of the Site (in this
                    case by the Controller);
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li><i>“third party”</i> when they are generated and managed by third-party providers outside the Site.
                    This Site is unable to control over these subjects and their cookies and to access the information they
                    collect. Responsibility for this type of cookie lies directly and exclusively with the third party
                    itself. Information about the use of these cookies and their purpose, as well as on how to disable them,

                </p>
      
                <p>Third-party analytical cookies are cookies set by a website other than the one you are currently visiting.
                </p>
      
                <p>This Site is unable to control over these subjects and their cookies and to access the information they
                  collect. Responsibility for this type of cookie lies directly and exclusively with the third party itself.
                  Information about the use of these cookies and their purpose, as well as on how to disable them, is
                  provided directly by the third party. Therefore, it is necessary to see the privacy and third-party
                  analytical cookie policies by visiting the websites of the third-party operators.
      
                </p>
      
                <p>Please note that generally the user tracking does not involve their identification, unless the User is not
                  already registered and also logged in, thus meaning that the User has already given his consent directly to
                  the third party at the time of registration to the service provided.
                </p>
                <p>The Site uses the following third-party analytical cookies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    “Google Analytics” that are used to collect and analyze statistical information about accesses/visits to
                    the Site. This type of cookie collects information in an anonymous form and will not allow the Site to
                    identify the User nor collect any information about their activity on the Site, the way they arrived at
                    the Site and the pages they visit. The Controller uses this information provided by Google Analytics for
                    statistical analysis, to improve the Site and simplify its use, as well as to monitor its proper
                    functioning.
                    </p>
      
                    <p>The data collected does not allow the personal identification of users, and is not crossed with other
                      information about the same person. They are processed in an aggregate and anonymous form (truncated by
                      the last octet). Google Inc. is not allowed to cross-reference this data with other services on the
                      basis of a specific agreement.

                <p><strong>3. Profiling cookies</strong></p>
                <p>Profiling cookies are designed to create user profiles in order to send advertisements in line with the

                <h4>C. Purposes</h4>
      
                <p>
                  The Site uses technical cookies to make it possible and easy for Users to navigate the Site as well as to
                  provide and allow Users to use its services.
                  The Site uses analytical cookies to anonymously analyze and monitor the way Users use the Site (e.g. number
                  of accesses and visited pages), for statistical purposes, and to enable improvements to the Site in terms
                  of operation and navigation.
                </p>
      
                <p>The site uses third party cookies to provide additional services and functionality to visitors and to
                  simplify the use of the Site, or to display targeted advertising.</p>
      
                <h4>D. Cookie Consent</h4>
      
                <p>
                  The Controller stores any user consent provided by means of a technical cookie, which has a duration of 12
                  months. The User is informed both by means of the short notice (banner displayed on the first visit of the
                  site until consent is given or denied) and by means of this extended policy; in addition, paragraph 4
                  provides links to third party privacy policies, as well as ways to disable the corresponding cookies -
                  where directly possible. As provided for by current legislation, explicit consent is recorded by means of a
                  technical cookie installed for which an action is required by the user: selecting the link "close", closing
                  the banner containing the brief information, or scrolling through the page. Provision of data is optional.
                  You can change your cookie preferences at any time by following the procedures described below. You can
                  also disable cookies from your browser at any time, but this may prevent you from using certain features of
                  the Site.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Responsibility for third-party cookies lies directly and exclusively with the third party itself.
                  Therefore, it is necessary to see the privacy and third-party cookie policies by visiting the websites of
                  the third-party operators listed in this Policy.

                </h4>
